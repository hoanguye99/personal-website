          Hello, my name is Hoang and I create things that live on the internet.
          I enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and
          engineering meet â€” things that look good but are also built well under
          the hood.
        </p>
        {/* <p>
          I spend a great deal of time tinkering with design systems, as I
          firmly believe that a high-quality UI is built on high-quality
          components. Components should not only be visually appealing but also
          interactive, with smooth and fluid transitions to enhance the user
          experience.
        </p> */}
        <p>
          I have had 5+ years working at FPT IS, 3+ years working as a frontend
          developer. In my job, I mainly focus on developing new features,
          improving existing UIs, maintaining the design system, reviewing code
          and mentoring new team members. I've also written a personal blog to
          explain the fundamentals of Tanstack Query to my team members.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently seeking a new opportunity where I can contribute to a
          product-focused team and collaborate in an English-speaking
          environment
